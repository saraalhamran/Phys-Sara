<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are my top 3 ideas in order:
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Teddy Bear</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Problem: Poor posture is a common issue caused by long periods of sitting and device use, often leading to back pain, fatigue, and long-term health problems. Most people are unaware when they begin to slouch, making it hard to build consistent posture habits without external feedback.
<br></br>
Solution: Posture Pal detects when your posture deviates from an upright position and gently alerts you (via vibration), helping you build awareness and form healthy posture habits over time, without distractions or shaming.
<br></br>
Creation: To create Posture Pal, I will 3D model and print a small clip-on case using Fusion 360, designed to be clipped on your upper back. Inside, I will install an Arduino Nano, MPU6050 sensor, LiPo battery, and vibration motor. The Arduino will be programmed to detect slouching using posture angle data and activate the motor for feedback.

<h4>Idea 3: Focus Vault</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Problem: Constant phone distractions reduce productivity and focus, especially during study sessions. Even with self-discipline, the temptation to check notifications or scroll endlessly.
<br></br>
Solution: Focus Vault is a physical lockbox that securely holds your phone while you study, only unlocking in the case of an emergency call. This eliminates casual phone use while still preserving essential access.
<br></br>
Creation: To create Focus Vault, I will design and 3D print a phone-sized lockbox with a secure lid mechanism. Inside, an Arduino Nano will be connected to a servo lock, a SIM module (or Bluetooth/phone detection module), and a battery. The system will monitor for emergency signals (like phone call buzzing), unlocking only under those conditions.

<h4>Idea 4: Hands-Free Textbook </h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Problem: Physical textbooks are heavy and hard to manage, requiring frequent page turns that interrupt focus, especially when your hands are busy taking notes or typing.
<br></br>
Solution: The Hands-Free Textbook Assistant automatically turns pages on command, allowing users to study seamlessly without interrupting their workflow. This supports deeper focus, accessibility, and more efficient studying.
<br></br>
Creation: To create the Hands-Free Textbook Assistant, I will design  and 3D print a foldable book stand with integrated mechanical arms for page flipping. Using an Arduino Nano, servo motors and sensors, the system will detect a signal and flip the page accordingly. I will prototype the mechanism, test different paper thicknesses and bindings to ensure that pages are flipped adequately.
