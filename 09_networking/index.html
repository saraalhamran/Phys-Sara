<h4>Assignment: Programming something with IOT!</h4>

<br>
<h4> Overview </h4>
<h5> I chose to do this in a group, shoutout to Emma and Helena! For our IOT assignment, we attempted to create 2 distinct interactive systems using the ESP32s. 
  <br>
  <h5> 1. An 8-Note Piezo Noisemaker controlled through a WebSocket-connected web interface.</h5>
<h5> 2. An RGB LED light controlled via Firebase Realtime Database and a custom HTML color picker.</h5>
<br>

<h3> Project 1: 8-Note WebSocket Piezo Buzzer </h3>
<br>
<h5> We intended to create a fun and intuitive way to control a piezo buzzer remotely. The idea was to let users pick musical notes from a dropdown menu, then send those notes to the ESP32 to be played on a piezo buzzer in real-time. This mimics the interaction style of an online synthesizer but runs locally on hardware. </h5>
<br>
<h4> Hardware used: </h4>
<br>

<h5> ESP32 Dev Module
<br>
Piezo buzzer (connected to GPIO 25)
<br>
Breadboard + jumper wires
<br>
Wi-Fi-enabled device to access the hosted webpage

<br> 


<h4> Web Interface + Real Time Communication </h4>
<br>

<h5> We used ESPAsyncWebServer and AsyncWebSocket libraries on the ESP32 to serve the HTML/JS frontend and receive WebSocket messages in real-time. The web interface included: <br>
8 dropdowns to select different musical notes.
<br>
A D3.js-generated music staff that visualizes the selected notes.
<br>
Red circle feedback for currently playing note




<br>


<h4> How it works: </h4>
<br>

<h5> User picks 8 notes from dropdown menus on the webpage.
<br>
The ESP parses the incoming JSON.
<br>
On clicking "Play", the browser packages the selections into a JSON object using formatSend() <br>
The JSON is sent to the ESP32 over WebSocket.

<br>
The ESP32 receives and parses the JSON (handleWebSocketMessage()), loads the note frequencies into an array, and sets a newRequest flag to true.

<br>
In the loop() function , the ESP32 iterates through the notes, using tone() to play them while sending visual cues back to the browser (ws.textAll()).
<br>
The browser uses onMessage() (image 4) to highlight the note currently being played on the D3.js staff.

<h3> Project 2: RGB LED Controlled via Firebase and Color Picker
</h3>
<br>
<h4>Overview </h4>
<br>

<h5> The goal was to control the color of an RGB LED using Firebase Realtime Database and a web-based color picker. This project focuses on cloud-to-device communication, using Firebase as the bridge between the user and the ESP32.</h5>
<br>


<h4> Hardware: </h4>
<h5> 
  <br>
ESP32 Dev Board
 <br>
Common cathode RGB LED (or 3 separate LEDs)
 <br>
Current-limiting resistors
 <br>
Breadboard + jumper wires </h5>

<h4> Firebase Setup </h4>
<br>

<h5> We created a new Firebase project and successfully set up a realtime Database, and used email authentication, however we faced a later issue with the security rules later on. But the core idea was for the ESP32 to connect to the Wifi, subscribe to Firebase cahnges, and account for the updated RGB values, then setting the appropritae PWM values on the red, green and blue pins. </h5>
<br>


<h4> Challenges Faced </h4>
<br>

<h5> The Firebase library failed to install correctly at first. Even after downloading the ZIP manually from GitHub, compilation errors persisted. Although we managed to get Firebase authentication working and confirmed the color data was being written to the database, the ESP32 didn’t respond as expected—possibly due to security rule conflicts or data path issues.

 </h5>
<br>

<h4> Progress </h4>
<br>

<h5> Firebase successfully received values from the color picker.

The ESP32 failed to act on the updates—likely due to unresolved Firebase read logic or missing serial debug feedback.

The RGB LED lit up once manually, indicating the hardware setup was correct.



 </h5>
<br>


<h4> Conclusion </h4>
<h5> These two projects taught us how to host and manage interactive web pages on ESP32s and use websockets for real-time data transmission. We also used firebase to link cloud-based databases with microcontrollers. Cloud bases are no joke, as we learned that any troubleshoot authentication/ connectivity issues will act as an obstacle if not solved. In the future, we would love to continue with our RGB project and get it up and running!
