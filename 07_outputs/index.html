<h3>Week 7: Electronic Outputs</h3>



<h4>Assignment: Minimum Viable Product for Final Project</h4>
<br> </br>

<h5> 
1. Designing the Teddy Box (Fusion 360 + Laser Cutting)


The laser cutting is still pending as I am brainstorming a smarter and more space-efficient pocket case that can hold the breadboard and charger while remaining visually fun and minimal. I plan to cut the prototype out of cardboard, then later build a polished version using either acrylic or wood. It will have:

A front OLED screen window

USB-C port opening

Back panel access

possibly a pause and reset button </h5>

<br> </br>

2. Input Device: Wireless Phone Charger as Sensor

Objective: Use a wireless charger’s analog pin (14) to detect if a phone is placed on it and actively charging.

Materials:

Wireless charger module (5V, analog signal out)

ESP32 Dev Board

Jumper wires

Wiring:

Charger analog signal pin → ESP32 pin 14 (ADC)

Charger VCC → ESP32 5V

Charger GND → ESP32 GND

Logic:
The analog value is sampled repeatedly. The board determines if a phone is truly charging (not just hovering nearby). When the charger reads around 5.5V , we know a phone is actively charging.

Feature:
The timer only starts when a phone is confirmed as charging. This is the heart of my project. I think I did a solid job with this logic—it works well overall—but there are minor glitches when the value briefly spikes, so I’ll continue improving this logic. </h5>

3. Output Device: LCD Timer Display (16x2)

This was my first time ever using an LCD screen, so I'm pretty proud of myself! The display should show study instructions and a Pomodoro-style 25 minute countdown timer

The display updates every second using millis() logic, without using the delay() function! </h5>
<br> </br>




<h5>
 4. Code Structure (C++ Style, No delay())

The logic is modular and responsive:

Uses a rolling average on the charger pin to detect real charging state

Uses a simple state machine to track transitions between "waiting," "charging," and "timer" modes

LCD updates occur only when state changes or countdown ticks

<h5> Oscilloscope:
I has already used an oscilloscope for the last assignment which was pretty helpful! It halped me determine the voltage that I should include in my code to determine wether the phone is charging or not </h5>
<br> </br>


<h5> Reflections & Challenges

Despite the project’s seemingly simple idea, building the working prototype took many hours of testing, rewiring, and debugging. I made the mistake of wiring the potentiometer at a 90° angle to the LCD instead of in parallel, it took hours to discover this small error, and the LCD wouldn’t display anything until fixed.

My proudest achievement was implementing the phone detection feature. Even though it’s not perfect yet, I created logic that reads analog voltage, averages it, and responds with meaningful states. I’ll continue refining the detection logic to make it even better.
