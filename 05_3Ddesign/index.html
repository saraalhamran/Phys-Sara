<h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing</h3>

<h5>For my first ever 3d-printed project, I was inspired by a 3d printed cone my calc teacher created, that I always found so addicting. I started with designing the model on Fusion360, I then decided to separate the two parts so they print individually.</h5>

<h5> I then transferred my work to Prusa Slicer, and to be frank I did not expect this small item to require 3 hours of printing time, but it was okay! I simply supervised the first layer and trusted the machine with the rest. Prusa got really mad at my model, as it involves intrifcate pieces sort of hanging onto nothing, and added so much support that it looks more like a volcano that a cone :0 </h5>

<h5> The printed results looked a bit funny? However I was keen to get it as clean as possible, which I think I did! I am proud that the two shapes fit, at least for the top part. I think the base of the shape still had some 3d printed support that needed to be cut off, hence the refusal to fully fit. </h5>

<h5> I originally wanted to scan my lipgloss, however it had a very reflective surface, same with my water bottle, which made it really hard to capture them on camera. Instead, I opted for a sculpture from the lab, and the scan turned out just fine! </h5>
