<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>

<h4>Kinetic Sculpture</h4>

<h4>For my kinetic sculpture, I have decided to depict the movement of a whale in the ocean, since whales have always interested me. To be frank, I had a really hard time getting the last assignment done on time, so I was eager to get this one right. A lot of aspects of my project are inspired from studentsâ€™ past work, especially the mechanism and connector to the motor (Shoutout to Mila Barry). </h4>

<h5>I started by sketching my idea in fusion, which is basically a finger joint box with holes, in which wooden dowls will fit into later, along with cams in the shapes of ellipses for the waves and whale to move, with the help of a rectangle with a hole in the middle to control that movement and keep it intact. I also created 6 circles with holes to serve as connectors to transition motion from the motor to the dowl. </h5>

<h6>I started by hot glueing three parts of the finger joint box to create a stable base for the sculpture. Even though the finger joiuints were a tiny bit off, it still fit just fine. I initially planned on using a wooden dowl, but found another metal one that match the 5m diameter I chose. Then I went ahead and glued the oval cams onto the dowl, with the rectangles resting on top. The tricky part was the fact that the top holes were off centered in relation to the 4 cams, but luckily i printed an extra box top so I just used that. That pretty much sums up the sculpture part of this project.</h6>
