<h3>Week 8: CNC Milling</h3>
<br> 

<h4>This week’s assignment has to be my favorite by far! Although the CNC setup was a pain, shoutout to Cassia for bearing with us, she’s the best! I am definitely planning on CNCing more items… if I have the time that is! </h4>
<br> 
<h3> 1.  CNC milling using ShopBot </h3>
<h4>
<br> 
This was very time consuming to say the least. To be fair, it was my first time ever getting my hands on the CNC machine so mistakes were made. I initially modeled this electric guitar on fusion, and I am actually so proud of how my design turned out! I used a reference outline image for the outline but designed the compartments myself. As you can tell from the image below, during the design period I had no idea how 
I wanted the final product to look like, so I did not account for the pitfalls that would occur if for instance my model was accidentally saved in two different sketches. (oopsies… again thank you Cassia for being patient with me!) </h4>

<h4> I worked with Cinar for this assignment, and I the CAD and he planned out the shapes of the cuts. This process taught me a lot. We started off be measuring the depth of the wood suing a caliper, which was approximately 19 inches deep. Then we transferred the two sketches into rhino and made necessary edits. </h4>
<br> 


<h4> This is the part that took nearly 30 minutes of going back and forth.  The vision that we were going for was for the inside lines on both corners to have different depth layers that are slightly different from one another, to create this cool effect that goes with the rising star in the middle of the guitar. Implementing this idea was quite challenging as I unknowingly merged all the guitar parts in one layer, not accounting for the fact that I would want to do a fancy cut.</h4>
<br> 

<h4> I am so happy with how the guitar turned out, and I think those cuts in the end were mesmerizing. </h4>
<h3> 2. Vaccuming</h3>
<br> 
<h4> 
For the vacuuming, we decided to use our guitar as well. Thank you Jessica for helping us set the machine up! A problem that we faced was not knowing that the plastic sheet had 2 sides that needed to be removed</h4><br> 
<h4>
Our first attempt was partly a fail, as there was a hole in the plastic mold, due to us peeling the first layer that we forgot to peel initially. So we decided to do it again.</h4><br> 


<h4>
The second attempt was a success! However we thought we had it all figured out by removing the side of the plastic paper, only to find out that there are actually 2 sides to be removed! But thankfully that did not interfere with our final product!</h4><br> 


<h3>
3.Molding and casting </h3>
<h4><br> 
We chose air casting as it is the most appropriate for our plastic mold. Following the thorough instructions on the back of the can, we measured the correct amount of water and powder, with the powder being 5 times more than water. We gradually mixed powder into water, until we reached a stiff ooblec-like consistency.</h4><br> 

<h4>
The rest of the process was pretty simple, we simply poured the mixture into our guitar mold, and came back to it 2 days later! Although the results are not perfect, it is so much better than I expected : ) </h4><br> 


<h3>
Lessons learned: </h3>

<h4>
Next time I plan to use the CNC machine, which hopefully I do, I will be very mindful of the type of cuts I plan on doing, and how the lines are connected with one another, and how easy the toolpath can be implemented. </h4><br>
